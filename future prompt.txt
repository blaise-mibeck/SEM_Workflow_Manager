# SEM_Workflow_Manager - Future Development Notes

## Recent Changes - SEM_Session_Manager Compatibility

We have updated SEM_Workflow_Manager to be fully compatible with SEM_Session_Manager's session information format. The following changes were made:

1. Enhanced the `SessionInfo` class in models/session.py to:
   - Support loading and saving session information in SEM_Session_Manager's JSON format
   - Add new fields from SEM_Session_Manager (session_type, project_number, stub_type, etc.)
   - Map field names to match SEM_Session_Manager conventions (tcl_id -> tcl_sample_id, client_sample_name -> client_sample_id)
   - Add support for session status (active/inactive) and timing information (creation_time, start_time, end_time, total_time_seconds)
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing SEM_Workflow_Manager sessions

2. Redesigned the `SessionPanel` UI in ui/session_panel.py to:
   - Organize fields into tabbed sections (Sample Info, Preparation, Additional Info)
   - Add UI elements for all SEM_Session_Manager fields
   - Enhance validation and form controls
   - Display session status and timing information in the statistics section

3. Updated documentation in readme.md to explain the compatibility with SEM_Session_Manager.

## Field Mapping Reference

## Integration Architecture

The integration between the two applications works as follows:

1. Both applications use the same session_info.json file format
2. SEM_Session_Manager creates a .json file and session summary text file when starting/stopping a session
3. SEM_Workflow_Manager can open these sessions, modify them, and save them in a format that SEM_Session_Manager can read
4. The session_info.json file serves as the common data exchange format

## Future Improvement Ideas

1. **Session Creation Integration**
   - Add ability to create new sessions directly in SEM_Workflow_Manager using the same naming conventions
   - Implement automatic folder naming based on session type and incrementing counter (e.g., "EDX1-018")

2. **Enhanced Session Summary**
   - Generate .txt summary files compatible with SEM_Session_Manager's format
   - Support saving summary files when sessions are modified or created

3. **Session Import/Export**
   - Batch import sessions from SEM_Session_Manager's archive
   - Export collections of sessions with metadata for backup or transfer

4. **Session Timing Controls**
   - Add UI controls to start/stop/pause sessions 
   - Track active vs. inactive state and duration

5. **Auto-Detection**
   - Monitor for new SEM_Session_Manager sessions and prompt to open them
   - Integrate with SEM_Session_Manager's file watch functionality if available

6. **Report Generation**
   - Generate reports that combine SEM_Session_Manager session info with grid visualizations
   - Create PDF reports that include session summary with representative images

7. **Metadata Integration**
   - Link SEM_Session_Manager's session fields with image metadata
   - Propagate relevant session fields to image metadata for searching/filtering

8. **User Profile Support**
   - Remember common values for operator, preparation methods, etc.
   - Fast presets for common session types and sample configurations

## Development Notes

- Both applications should maintain their independence while sharing data
- Changes to the session_info.json format should be backward compatible
- Testing should include session interchange between both applications
- Consider creating a shared library for session manipulation functions

This integration enhances the workflow by allowing session management to be handled by SEM_Session_Manager while visualization and analysis are handled by SEM_Workflow_Manager, creating a complete end-to-end solution.
